# Python Essentials (exam PCEP-30-02)

--- 
A place where I keep my solutions to the exercises from the material of the 
Edeba course: Python Essentials (exam PCEP-30-02). Since this repository is public
anyone can use it as a reference for a solution to some of the exercises.

I know a bit about python language, but I want to attempt the first official exam on Python and
having a place when I can go to review the material and the exercises is a good idea. So I thought, since
I'm doing it for myself, why not make it public so anyone can use it as well.

The link for the course is [here](https://edube.org/study/pe1).

Also, this is the [link](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) for the exam.
